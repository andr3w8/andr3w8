Hello 🌍!

I'm Andrew 😎!

I am an ambitious Ruby/Python programmer. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96133689/162616101-11b21063-c4fd-4d6a-829b-ad0abf70f1c8.png)


I am also a calm person who has developed a mature and responsible approach to any task that I undertake, or situation that I am presented with. 👨‍💻

I love to learn new things and I like it the most when I struggle because that's when I give everything I can to learn to grow. 🎯

I am currently working at Eventya.Co as a Ruby language programmer.

I am also studying the full-stack developer part on the Udemy platform in an accredited course. 👨‍🎓

Top 3 of my passions => I love to cycling through forests 🚴🏽‍♀️, latin dancing 💃 🕺 an cooking.
